Well my plans for this site were to use it for work or entertainment puposes. I really enjoy doing art or anything creative and whatever I did I would upload to this website to be all in one pllace. 
Sadly, my website didn't turn out how I wanted it to. I've never done any kind of coding before and required a lot of help from YouTube videos and multiple phone calls.
Even then it was still difficult to understand and I think I attempted to do a website far out of my reach with my current coding abilitly. 
I am happy that I was able to get some assemblence of a working website even though it is by far not perfect.
